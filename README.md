# Plex Webhooks Automation

This project allows you to automatically control the lights in your house when using Plex.

## Features

- Automatically turn off lights when you (start / resume) watching a movie on Plex.
- Automatically turn on lights when you (stop / pause) a movie on Plex.
- Supports Philips Hue bulbs and Shelly Plugs.

## Installation

- Install the latest LTS version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Clone the repository.
- Install dependencies using `npm install`.
- Copy `config/application.base.json` to `config/application.json`.

## Automatic Configuration

We've created setup scripts to help configure the application for you:

- If you're using Philips Hue bulbs with a bridge: Run the setup script using `npm run setup-hue`.
- If you want to automatically pull through your Plex players. Run the setup script using `npm run setup-plex`.

If you would rather set it up manually use the manual configuration steps below.

## Manual Configuration

- You can manually configure the application config in `config/application.json`
- I would recommend using the `config/aplication.example.json` as a template and working from there.
- Get device id from https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/settings/devices/all and add it to the `device` field in the config.
- Find your bulb ids in whatever home lighting integration you're using.

## Build

If you would like to run the application using regular Node JS, you will need to build the application first.

- Build the latest code using `npm run build`.

## Run

If you have built the application and would like to run it using Node JS, you can do so by running:

- Set environment variable `export CONFIG_PATH=./config/your.application.json` (or set it in your IDE).
- Start the app using `npm start`.

Alternatively, you can run the application using `ts-node`:

- Start the app using `npm run start-dev`.

## Add Webhook to Plex

- Add `http://localhost:12000` to https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/settings/webhooks
